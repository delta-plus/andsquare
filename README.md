A React Native app for Android to make and keep track of bets. In the future, I hope to add a provably fair voting system with cryptocurrency smart contracts. Hopefully, this app will serve not only as a fun way for people to fairly conduct wagers but also as a proof-of-concept for good electronic voting. I also plan on reusing most of the code to build iOS and web versions of the app.
